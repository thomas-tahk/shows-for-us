2. **Broadway API**: Supplement with musical details and cast information
3. **Local Database**: Cache and normalize data from both sources

### Phase 2: Enhanced Data
1. **Web Scraping**: Playbill for news and announcements
2. **Manual Curation**: Fill gaps with community-sourced data
3. **Third-party APIs**: Explore additional sources as needed

### Data Synchronization
