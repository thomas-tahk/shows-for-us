# Development Log

## Session 1 - Initial Setup (Current)

### Date: [Current Session]

#### Planning Phase
- ✅ Defined project scope and requirements
- ✅ Researched data sources (Ticketmaster, Broadway API)
- ✅ Evaluated authentication solutions (chose Supabase)
- ✅ Designed data model architecture
- ✅ Created MVP feature list

#### Technical Setup
- ✅ Initialized project structure with React + Node.js + TypeScript
- ✅ Created shared TypeScript interfaces for all data models
- ✅ Set up Express server with basic configuration
- ✅ Configured environment variables and security
- ✅ Created comprehensive .gitignore files
- ✅ Established documentation structure

#### Key Decisions
- **Project Name**: "shows-for-us"
- **Development Order**: Data modeling → API integration → Authentication
- **Search Strategy**: Fuzzy search from the start
- **Location Strategy**: Browser geolocation with manual fallback
- **Data Architecture**: Musical → Production → Performance hierarchy

#### Technical Achievements
- Express server configured with TypeScript
- Comprehensive data models defined
- Development environment prepared
- Security measures implemented (environment variables)
- Documentation system established

#### Next Steps
- Set up Supabase database schema
- Create API routes for core data models
- Implement Ticketmaster API integration
- Add fuzzy search functionality

### Development Environment
- **Node.js**: Latest LTS
- **TypeScript**: 5.8.3
- **Express**: 5.1.0
- **Vite**: Latest (for React frontend)
- **Package Manager**: npm

### Issues Encountered
- Terminal visual bug during development (resolved by restart)
- None significant during setup phase

### Performance Considerations
- Planned API caching strategy to minimize external API calls
- Designed data model to support efficient queries
- Structured project for scalability

### Security Measures
- Comprehensive .gitignore files for all environments
- Environment variable templates created
- API key security planned for external integrations
